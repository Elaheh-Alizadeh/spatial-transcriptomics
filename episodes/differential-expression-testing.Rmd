## Introduction to Differential Expression Testing

Differential expression testing is crucial in bioinformatics for identifying 
genes that show significant differences in expression across different samples 
or groups. 
This method helps find genes that are upregulated or downregulated in specific 
contexts, providing insights into biological functions and disease mechanisms.

## Differential Expression Analysis

### Differential Expression Using Expert's Annotation

We will begin by performing differential expression across the annotated layers. 
As a reminder, those look like:

```{r layers,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
SpatialDimPlotColorSafe(filter_st[, !is.na(filter_st[[]]$layer_guess)], "layer_guess") + 
  labs(fill = "Layer") 
```

We identify genes that are upregulated in each annotated brain region using the `FindAllMarkers` function from the Seurat toolkit, utilized with the Presto library, by comparing their expression levels against all other regions. Presto significantly enhances the computational speed of this analysis, delivering quicker results. For more details on the function and its parameters, see the [Seurat FindAllMarkers documentation](https://satijalab.org/seurat/reference/findallmarkers).

```{r layer-de}
Idents(filter_st)  <- "layer_guess"
de_genes           <- FindAllMarkers(filter_st, 
                                     assay    = "SCT",
                                     verbose  = FALSE,
                                     only.pos = TRUE, 
                                     min.pct  = 0.25, 
                                     logfc.threshold = 0.25)

```
## Moran's I Statistic

Moran's I is a measure used to assess spatial autocorrelation in data, 
indicating whether similar values are clustered, dispersed, or random. 
In bioinformatics, it's applied to detect genes whose expression patterns 
exhibit clear spatial structure, aiding in understanding spatially localized 
biological processes.

![Moran's I statistic visualized across four different spatial patterns.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Moran%27s_I_example.png)
**Top Left:** Checkerboard pattern results in negative Moran's I, indicating anti-correlation. **Top Right:** Linear gradient shows a high positive Moran's I, reflecting a strong spatial gradient. **Bottom Left:** Random pattern leads to a Moran's I near zero, suggesting no significant spatial autocorrelation. **Bottom Right:** 'Ink blot' pattern demonstrates positive autocorrelation, indicative of a clustered or spreading pattern. Relationships are calculated using direct, equally weighted neighbors, normalized for each cell.

### Spatial Differential Expression Using Moran's I

We identify the genes whose expression patterns exhibit clear spatial structure 
using Moran's I algorithm.

> DMG: Can one of you elaborate on what Moran's I is? And possibly add a reference?

```{r moran-i,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
svg <- 
  FindSpatiallyVariableFeatures(filter_st, 
                                assay            = "SCT", 
                                features         = VariableFeatures(filter_st)[1:1000], 
                                selection.method = "moransi")
```

## Correlation of Differentially Expressed Genes in each Brain Region and genes with highset Moran's I value.

### Heatmap of Differential Expression

```{r heatmap-de,fig.width=6}
# Get and sort 'MoransI_observed' values
morans_i_genes <- svg@assays[["SCT"]]@meta.features %>%
                    rownames_to_column("gene") %>%
                    arrange(desc(MoransI_observed)) %>%
                    slice_head(n = 100)

# Merge the Moran's I values with the DE genes
df <- merge(morans_i_genes, de_genes, all.x = TRUE, by = "gene")
df <- subset(df, !is.na(cluster))

# Create a matrix whose rows are the spatially variable genes (indicated by Moran's I),
# whose columns are the clusters, and whose entries are the adjusted DE pvalue for the
# corresponding gene and cluster.
p_val_adj_matrix <- df %>%
                       select(gene, cluster,p_val_adj) %>%
                       pivot_wider(names_from = cluster, values_from = p_val_adj, values_fill = 1.0) %>%
                       column_to_rownames("gene") %>%
                       as.matrix()

# Create a heatmap of the DE pvalues of spatially variable genes
Heatmap(p_val_adj_matrix2,
        column_title      = "Heatmap of DE p-values of spatially DE genes",
        name              = "DE p-values", # Title for the heatmap legend
        row_title         = "Spatially variable genes",
        cluster_rows      = TRUE, 
        cluster_columns   = FALSE,
        show_row_names    = FALSE, 
        show_column_names = TRUE,
        show_row_dend     = FALSE, 
        show_column_dend  = TRUE)

```

The heatmap visualization reveals a key finding of our analysis: genes displaying the highest Moran's I values show distinct expression patterns that align with specific brain regions identified through expert annotations. 
This observation underscores the spatial correlation of gene expression, highlighting its potential relevance in understanding regional brain functions and pathologies.
