## Spatial transcriptomics in biomedical research
Investigating the three-dimensional arrangement of cells and tissues and its 
impact on function is fundamental to life sciences research. Spatially resolved 
transcriptomic methods map positions of individual cells in a tissue and their 
expression in space, clarifying the physical relationships between cells. This
spatial information positions cell-to-cell interactions within tissues, 
delivering comprehensive gene expression profiling of tissues. Spatial 
transcriptomics is used to shed light on questions in neurobiology, tumor 
biology and more.  

## Spatial transcriptomics technologies
Imaging-based technologies read transcriptomes with microscopy using in situ 
sequencing or multiplexed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).
The kinds of biological questions that can be answered with imaging-based 
methods are, for example, ............


describe target coverage, spatial resolution and throughput for each method ....
