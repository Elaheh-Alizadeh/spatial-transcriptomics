## Deconvolution in Spatial Transcriptomics

Spatial transcriptomics (ST) provides valuable insights into the spatial distribution of gene expression within tissue
sections. However, each spatial spot in an ST experiment often contains multiple cells, leading to mixed gene expression
signals. Deconvolution is needed to resolve these mixed signals into individual cell type contributions, allowing for a
more accurate interpretation of the spatial gene expression data.

## Why Deconvolution is Needed

Mixed cell populations in each spot of an ST dataset can lead to complex, mixed gene expression profiles. Deconvolution
helps quantify the different cell types within each spot, enabling more precise biological insights and downstream analyses
such as cell type-specific expression patterns and interactions.

## Deconvolution with RCTD

RCTD (Robust Cell Type Decomposition) (Cable, D. M., et al., Nature Biotechnology, 2021) is a popular deconvolution
algorithm designed to handle the complexities of mixed cell populations in spatial transcriptomics data. The algorithm uses
single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data as a reference to deconvolute the spatial transcriptomics data, estimating the
proportions of different cell types in each spatial spot. The RCTD algorithm models the observed gene expression in each
spatial spot as a mixture of the gene expression profiles of different cell types and estimates the proportion of each cell
type in each spot using a non-negative least squares (NNLS) approach. RCTD can operate in various modes to fit multiple
cell types per pixel, improving the accuracy of the decomposition.

## Loading Single Cell RNA-Seq Data

First, we load the single-cell RNA-seq data that will serve as a reference for deconvolution. This data is essential for
mapping the gene expression profiles from the ST data to specific cell types.

```{r}
# Load single-cell RNA-seq data
sc.counts <- read.table("C:\\Users\\somara\\Documents\\sc_counts.tsv", sep = "\t", header = TRUE, row.names = 1, quote = "", check.names = FALSE)

# Load cell type annotations
cofactor_loaded <- read.table("C:\\Users\\somara\\Documents\\sc_cell_types.tsv", sep = "\t", header = TRUE, quote = "", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
cofactor_values_factor <- factor(cofactor_loaded$Value)
sc.cell.types <- setNames(cofactor_values_factor, cofactor_loaded$Name)
```

## Deconvolution with RCTD

RCTD (Robust Cell Type Decomposition) is a powerful tool that uses scRNA-seq reference data to deconvolute the spatial
transcriptomics data, thereby quantifying the cell types present in each spatial spot.

```{r}
rctd.wrapper <- function(st.obj, sc.counts, sc.cell.types, rds.output.file = NULL, run.rctd = TRUE, intersect.sc.and.st.genes = FALSE) {
  if(!is.null(rds.output.file) && file.exists(rds.output.file)) {
    myRCTD <- readRDS(rds.output.file)
    gc()
    return(myRCTD)
  }
  
  # Get raw ST counts
  st.counts <- GetAssayData(st.obj, assay="Spatial", slot="counts")
  
  # Get the spot coordinates
  st.coords <- st.obj[[]][, c("col", "row")]
  colnames(st.coords) <- c("x","y")
  
  # Get the number of UMI per spot
  nUMI <- colSums(st.counts)
  
  # Create the RCTD 'puck', representing the ST data
  puck <- SpatialRNA(st.coords, st.counts, nUMI)
  
  # Create an RCTD scRNA-seq reference
  if(intersect.sc.and.st.genes) {
    sc.counts <- sc.counts[rownames(sc.counts) %in% rownames(st.counts),]
  }
  sc.cell.types <- sc.cell.types[colnames(sc.counts)]
  nUMI <- colSums(sc.counts)
  reference <- Reference(sc.counts, sc.cell.types, nUMI, n_max_cells = ncol(sc.counts) + 1)
              
  max_cores <- min(5, detectCores() - 1)
  
  myRCTD <- create.RCTD(puck, reference, max_cores = max_cores, keep_reference = TRUE)
  
  if(run.rctd) {
    myRCTD <- suppressPackageStartupMessages(run.RCTD(myRCTD, doublet_mode = 'full'))
  }
  
  if(!is.null(rds.output.file)) {
    saveRDS(myRCTD, rds.output.file)
  }
  
  gc()
  myRCTD
}
```
## Running Deconvolution on Brain Samples

We apply the RCTD wrapper to our spatial transcriptomics data to deconvolute the spots and quantify the cell types. Here,
two different samples are analyzed.

```{r}
# Deconvolution for brain sample 1
result_1 <- rctd.wrapper(brain1, sc.counts, sc.cell.types, "rctd_st_brains_new.rds")
print_RCTD_results(brain1, result_1, 'brains_new.png')

# Deconvolution for brain sample 2
result_2 <- rctd.wrapper(brain2, sc.counts, sc.cell.types, "rctd_st_brains_new2.rds")
print_RCTD_results(brain2, result_2, 'brains_new2.png')
```
## Interpreting Deconvolution Results

The deconvolution process outputs the proportion of different cell types in each spatial spot, allowing for a detailed
understanding of the tissue composition. These results can be visualized and further analyzed to draw biological insights
about the tissue sections.

## Summary

Incorporating deconvolution into the spatial transcriptomics workflow enhances the ability to quantify the different cell
types in each spatial spot, providing a richer and more detailed understanding of the tissue architecture. By following
these steps, researchers can ensure that their spatial transcriptomics data is accurately deconvoluted, leading to more
robust and insightful analyses.
