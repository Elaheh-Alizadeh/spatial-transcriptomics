## Spatial transcriptomics in biomedical research
Investigating the organization of cells and tissues is fundamental to life 
sciences research. Spatially resolved transcriptomic methods map positions of individual cells in a tissue and measure their expression, delivering valuable
information about cell and tissue organization and function. Cell position and
expression can describe a cell's phenotype, state, and cell and tissue function
while clarifying the physical relationships between individual cells and 
cellular structures. A cell's position sheds light on signals it receives 
through cell-to-cell interactions or from dissolved signaling molecules nearby. 
Spatial information positions cell signaling while delivering comprehensive gene expression profiling within tissues.

Spatial transcriptomics addresses a key obstacle in single-cell studies: the 
loss of spatial information when tissues are dissociated to release viable,
intact cells. Spatial organization and structure determine function in most
tissues and organs, so capturing spatial information is critical for 
understanding function in neuroscience, cancer biology, and developmental 
biology. Immunology is the only field that doesn't require spatial information
to determine structure and function because immune cells often circulate in 
liquid media like blood and lymph. 

Spatial 
transcriptomics can shed light on questions in neuroscience, cancer biology and 
more.  




## Spatial transcriptomics technologies
Spatial transcriptomics technologies fall within two broad groups: imaging-based
methods and sequencing-based methods. 
Imaging-based technologies read transcriptomes with microscopy using in situ 
sequencing or multiplexed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).
The kinds of biological questions that can be answered with imaging-based 
methods are, for example, ............

Sequencing-based methods capture and sequence RNA in situ.


describe target coverage, spatial resolution and throughput for each method ....

:::::: keypoints
 - Spatial transcriptomics provides the location of individual cells relative to neighboring cells and cell structures.
 - A cell's location is useful data for describing its phenotype, state, and cell and tissue function.
 - Spatial transcriptomics addresses a key obstacle in single-cell studies: the loss of spatial information when tissues are dissociated.
